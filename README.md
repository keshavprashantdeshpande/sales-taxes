# sales-taxes
The main aim of this project is to complete the task of calculation the sales tax for the given list of items purchased.
# Use cases
Before moving on to the actual design first I decided to go through some use cases so that it becomes easy to understand the scope of the project and the scope of the design document.
Here are some typical use cases which a particular user of the system will be able to perform
1. Add new kind of product in the system
2. Calculate sales tax of the product list. If the product is imported add the tax rate accordingly
3. Create a shopping basket which has the price of the items along with other details
4. Calculate and print the final amount of the shopping basket

For the first phase of the design document only the typical use cases were considered
